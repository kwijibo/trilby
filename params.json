Just copy Trilby\r\nto your webserver and point your web browser to it. Fill in a short form\r\nnaming your dataset and uploading your RDF file, and it's done!\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n* Free Text Search\r\n* Faceted Browsing\r\n* Path-based Query Language\r\n* Geo-search (find things near other things)\r\n* Linked Data - URIs that start with where you installed Trilby\r\n  content-negotiate to HTML, RDF/JSON, and Turtle\r\n* VoID Metadata.(Todo)\r\n\r\n##Small\r\n\r\nTrilby aims to make it very easy to dynamically publish smaller\r\ndatasets. Instead of SPARQL or a database server for storing the data, Trilby's\r\nbackend, Raffles, uses a file-based storage system. This makes Trilby\r\nvery simple to setup, and lets it query over small amounts of data\r\nquickly and efficiently. However it is not an appropriate choice for\r\nmedium-to-large datasets.\r\n\r\n###How Small?\r\n\r\n So far I have tried with RDF data files of up to\r\nabout 30MB, and while queries are still reasonably fast, it does take\r\nseveral minutes to upload the file to Trilby.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n1. Use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to download Trilby. \r\n2. Put it where you want on your webserver. (eg, in the web root folder,\r\n   or a sub directory).\r\n3. Point your browser to it.\r\n4. You should be redirected to `/_setup` where you can upload your RDF data\r\n   file, give your dataset a name and license, and choose prefixes for\r\n   your data's vocabularies. You can also pick a password to protect\r\n   your configuration.\r\n5. Save, and you'll be directed to `/` where you can now search and browse\r\n   your data as Linked Data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Trilby"}
